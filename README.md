# Elixir users

I noticed that people are trying to organize Elixir meetups. This should help with head count to organize Elixir meetups in places where there are users.

Maybe you can also meet some in person.


## How to add yourself?

* Copy paste this block, as another element of the `features` key, in the `elixir-users.geojson` file:

```
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [12.9667, 77.5667]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Akash Manohar",
    "github": "HashNuke",
    "twitter": "HashNuke"
  }
}
```

* Then edit your details in the `properties` key. GitHub username is a must. The rest are optional.

* Then send a pull request.

## Who... why... what?

I, [HashNuke](http://github.com/HashNuke) made this.
