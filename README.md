# Elixir users

### [View](https://github.com/HashNuke/elixir-users/blob/master/elixir-users.geojson) or [Add person](https://github.com/HashNuke/elixir-users/blob/master/docs/how-to-add-person.md) or [Add meetup](https://github.com/HashNuke/elixir-users/blob/master/docs/how-to-add-meetup.md)

I noticed that people are trying to organize Elixir meetups. This project should help find meetup groups or provide head count to organize Elixir meetups in newer places.

Blue markers are users. Red markers are meetups.
