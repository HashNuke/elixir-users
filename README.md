# Elixir users

### [View](https://github.com/HashNuke/elixir-users/blob/master/elixir-users.geojson) or [Add person](https://github.com/HashNuke/elixir-users/blob/master/docs/how-to-add-person.md) or [Add meetup](https://github.com/HashNuke/elixir-users/blob/master/docs/how-to-add-meetup.md)

This project should help find Elixir meetup groups or provide head count to organize Elixir meetups in newer places.

Yellow markers are users. Red markers are meetups (TODO: use some other color that's not red or green. Which one?).


### Who... why... what?

I, [HashNuke](http://github.com/HashNuke) made this.

> Sir, while you are still here, may I interest you in some snake oil serum?
